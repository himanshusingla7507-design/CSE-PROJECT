PROJECT NAME - PET CARE APPOINTMENT PROGRAM

------------------------------

This project is based on the Pet Care Appointment program. This Pet Care Appointment Program is a user-friendly system designed to help pet owners schedule and manage appointments for their pets. It allows users to book services like grooming, check-ups, vaccinations, and training. The program stores pet details, appointment dates, and service information, making it easy to keep track of upcoming visits and ensure timely care for pets. In this program I have used several operator include conditional, looping operations and below are the following information for using this program.

  Tools in my project:
  --------------------
  * Create New Appointment
  * View All Appointments
  * Update An Appointment
  * Delete An Appointment

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) In the below attached image we can see that if we input 1 then we create a new appointment for a pet which includes (pet's name, pet's owner name, appointment time).

   So, Here a new appointment is made by Himanshu who's pet name is Tommy at around 10:00 am.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) So if we want to view all appointments we have to input 2.

   <img width="517" height="278" alt="cse-11 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae09153-85fe-426b-a2c5-74d629aa5517" />

   In this we can see that there is only one appointment for Tommy has been created.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Now if we want to update an appointment we have to input 3.

   <img width="628" height="692" alt="cse-11 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c261c901-f679-45ad-9d70-ea4180ec6673" />

   As we can see that Himanshu came back with his dog tommy and took the appointment at 1:00 pm. So his appointment deatails has been updated. Now if we want to check the
   updates we have to input 2 (view all oppointments). Here the appointment details have been updated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) At the end if we want to Delete an appointmemt we have to input 4.

   <img width="582" height="340" alt="cse-11 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/969a5716-28b9-4ae0-90dc-bb9dd2c492ed" />

   So as we can see, after pressing input 4 the appointment for Tommy has been cancelled and deleted.
